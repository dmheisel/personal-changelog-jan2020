# Personal Changelog for Jan, 2020

## Outline
This is a changelog / tracker for the Jan, 2020 [30 Day Challenge](https://github.com/dmheisel/personal-changelog-jan2020.git)

The idea is that for the next 30 days, I'll be tracking at least 15 minutes/day where I've engaged in some form of learning or personal growth, and sharing that growth here as a form of accountability.  This is the first challenge I've taken part in, so let's see how it goes!
